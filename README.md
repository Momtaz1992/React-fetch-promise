Fetch API and Promise Exercises in React JavaScript
This is a repository containing a set of exercises for practicing the use of Fetch API and Promises in React JavaScript.

Exercises
Fetching Data: Write a React component that fetches data from the following API endpoint and displays a list of the first 5 posts on the screen: https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/posts

Sending Data to an API: Write a React component that allows the user to enter a new post and sends it to the following API endpoint: https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/posts. The component should display a success message when the new post is created.

Handling Errors: Update the React component from Exercise 2 to handle errors that may occur when sending the new post to the API. If an error occurs, the component should display an error message on the screen.
